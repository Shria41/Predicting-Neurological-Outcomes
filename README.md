# Predicting-Neurological-Outcomes-in-Comatose-Cardiac-Arrest-Patients
Cardiac arrest is a global health concern, with millions of cases reported annually and variable survival rates across different regions. A significant challenge in the management of post-cardiac arrest patients lies in accurately predicting neurological recovery. Prognostic decisions made in the early days following cardiac arrest can significantly impact patient outcomes. 
To address these challenges, our research leverages continuous electroencephalography (EEG) to predict neurological outcomes in comatose patients after cardiac arrest. We introduce a novel approach that incorporates a stacked ensemble model, combining an RNN model and an SVM model with a non-linear kernel, with KNN serving as the meta-classifier. This approach involves an analysis of EEG features extracted using Welch's power spectral density, resulting in a reduced feature subset and a subsequent enhancement in accuracy. Our methodology showcases an impressive predictive accuracy of 95.3\%.
This research paper outlines our contributions to the field, highlighting the importance of automated EEG analysis in improving prognostic accuracy. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of our findings for clinical practice.
