# Predicting-Neurological-Outcomes-in-Comatose-Cardiac-Arrest-Patients
Cardiac arrest is a global health concern, with millions of cases reported annually and variable survival rates across different regions. A significant challenge in the management of post-cardiac arrest patients lies in accurately predicting neurological recovery. Prognostic decisions made in the early days following cardiac arrest can significantly impact patient outcomes. 
To address these challenges, our research leverages continuous electroencephalography (EEG) to predict neurological outcomes in comatose patients after cardiac arrest. We introduce a novel approach that incorporates a stacked ensemble model, combining an RNN model and an SVM model with a non-linear kernel, with KNN serving as the meta-classifier. This approach involves an analysis of EEG features extracted using Welch's power spectral density, resulting in a reduced feature subset and a subsequent enhancement in accuracy. Our methodology showcases an impressive predictive accuracy of 95.3\%.
This research paper outlines our contributions to the field, highlighting the importance of automated EEG analysis in improving prognostic accuracy. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of our findings for clinical practice.

_**Data Extraction**_ \
The data used in this research comes from about seven hospitals that are academic based in the US and Europe. These hospitals are led by "I-CARE" which stands for "International Cardiac Arrest Research Consortium". This database has data from patients who had a cardiac arrest and have then remained comatose. Neurological recovery was determined using the Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) ordinal scale ranging from 1 to 5.\
Patients achieving a CPC score of 1 or 2 were classified as having a good recovery, indicating either good neurological function or moderate disability. Conversely, scores of 3, 4, or 5 were indicative of bad recovery, encompassing severe disability, unresponsiveness, or mortality, respectively. We iterated through all the 606 patient directories, extracted the required features, and appended them to a CSV file. 

_**Results and Conclusion**_ \
Using base classifier 1, the model demonstrated  a training accuracy of approximately 0.948 and a validation accuracy of 0.918. Additionally, the model exhibited a test accuracy of 0.86, confirming its robust performance in classifying neurological outcomes.\
Base classifier 2 included utilizing the newly devised kernel. An SVM model was constructed achieving an accuracy of 0.90.\
Our analysis reveals a noteworthy improvement in classification accuracy when employing the ensemble method  compared to the individual base classifiers. Specifically, Ensemble model 1, utilizing all power spectral density features, yielded an accuracy of 0.943.
Ensemble Model 3 incorporated Discrete Wavelet Transform features, yielding a commendable accuracy score of 0.943 as well.
In light of our findings from the power spectra feature analysis, we refined our feature selection approach by narrowing our focus to specific power spectral density features. For individuals with poor recovery outcomes, we chose to retain features from the alpha and beta frequency bands. Conversely, for those with favorable recovery outcomes, we opted to include features exclusively from the delta and theta frequency bands.
Ensemble model 2 leveraged this reduced set of features and exhibited an even higher accuracy of 0.951. Ensemble model 2 not only outperformed in accuracy but also demonstrated lower Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values. Additionally, it achieved the highest F1-score of 0.944 (weighted). This outcome is particularly remarkable as Ensemble 2 achieved superior accuracy despite utilizing a reduced feature set, reducing the dimensionality from 117 to 81 features, highlighting the effectiveness of feature selection in enhancing model performance.
In conclusion, our research has showcased the potential of ensemble learning methodologies to significantly enhance the accuracy and performance of classification tasks in the context of post-cardiac arrest neurological recovery assessment. By amalgamating diverse machine learning and deep learning models, we formulated a robust stacked ensemble framework that outperformed individual base classifiers.
