For the "TTM" attribute, missing values were replaced with the most frequent value observed among the existing data points, taking into account the available values of 33, 36, or indicating the absence of "TTM".
In the case of "Vfib" , missing entries were imputed by considering the count of "true" (1) and "false" (0) instances within each CPC category, with the most prevalent value assigned.
For the "ROSC" attribute, missing values were predicted using multiple linear regression. The model was trained using the available rows that did not have missing values, and this trained model was used to predict the values for the remaining rows with missing data.
