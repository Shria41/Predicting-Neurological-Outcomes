We conducted an analysis on the power spectra features. 

power_code.py consists of code that calculates the average power in each of the frequecny bands, namely, alpha, beta, theta and delta.

power1.py prints the analysis found from the power spectra.

Results: We observed that individuals with good recovery exhibited relatively lower average spectral power in the alpha and beta bands compared to those with poor recovery, suggesting a potential association between reduced activity in these frequency ranges and more favorable neurological outcomes. 
We also saw that particularly in the delta and theta frequency bands,  individuals with good recovery exhibited slightly higher average spectral power compared to those with poor recovery. 
We also observed an overall higher average spectral power in the good recovery group compared to those with poor recovery.
